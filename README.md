We have made a presentation about the different aspects of the SPOT quadruped, and have included the following points:
1) Sensors 
2) Material and Manufacturing 
3) Algorithms and computation power
4) Actuators
5) Controllers
6) ROS

Most of the documentation are speculations, as Boston Dynamics does not release any information about its robots.
